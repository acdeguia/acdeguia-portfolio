      <p>
        My web developer journey began with my pursuit of a bachelorâ€™s degree in
        Computer Science. From a young age, I have always felt a spark of
        curiosity and passion for the field. The inner drive motivates me to
        continuously push myself to learn & grow. I am deeply committed to
        personal and professional development, constantly seeking opportunities
        to expand my knowledge and skills.
